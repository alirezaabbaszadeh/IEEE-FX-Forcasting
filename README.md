## Overview

Accurate and robust forecasting of Forex rates is vital for financial institutions and traders. This project proposes a hybrid model combining residual attention mechanisms with a mixture-of-experts ensemble to improve hour-ahead exchange rate predictions. The architecture synergizes deep learning capabilities for feature extraction and expert aggregation for prediction robustness.

## Features

- **Residual Attention Mechanisms:** Enhance feature learning and focus on critical patterns.
- **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE):** Ensemble of specialized neural networks for robust, diverse predictions.
- **Time-Series Forecasting:** Designed for financial sequence data (Forex).
- **Fully implemented in Python.**

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](docs/architecture.png) 

- **Input:** Historical Forex data (OHLCV, technical indicators, etc.)
- **Feature Extraction:** Deep neural networks with residual attention layers.
- **Experts:** Multiple specialized subnetworks.
- **Gating Network:** Dynamically combines experts' outputs.
- **Output:** Hour-ahead Forex rate forecast.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alirezaabbaszadeh/iccke25-forex-hybrid.git
   cd iccke25-forex-hybrid
   ```
## Dataset

- The model expects time-series Forex data with standard features (e.g., Open, High, Low, Close, Volume).
- Example data format:
  ```
  Timestamp,Open,High,Low,Close,Volume
  2024-01-01 00:00,1.1234,1.1250,1.1220,1.1240,1000
  ...
  ```
