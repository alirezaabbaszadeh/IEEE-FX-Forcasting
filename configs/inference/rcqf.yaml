# Regime-conditioned quantile forecasting profile for targeted stress experiments.
quantile_levels: [0.05, 0.5, 0.95]
regime_labelling:
  window: 96
  min_periods: 24
  calm_quantile: 0.25
  stress_quantile: 0.85
  tail_quantile: 0.975
  smoothing_span: 32
  stress_zscore: 2.5
  clip_zscore: 6.0
notes: >-
  Use alongside RCQF checkpoints when purged conformal calibration underperforms.
  The configuration mirrors the defaults in `src/features/regime_labels.py` for
  reproducibility across evaluation pipelines.
