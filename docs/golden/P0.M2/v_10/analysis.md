## Leakage Assessment

### Strengths
- Combines strengths of MultiHeadAttention and AdditiveAttention with MoE to benchmark hybrid aggregator.
- Configuration exposes both attention mechanisms for tuning.

### Risks
- Complex aggregator chain increases risk of silent dtype mismatches under mixed precision.
- Validation split unchanged (96/2/2) leaving leakage detection difficult.

### Recommended Mitigations
- Add integration tests that run under mixed precision and float32 to compare outputs.

## Validation Notes
- Confirm split ratios and block configurations via the companion inventory checklist before reruns.
