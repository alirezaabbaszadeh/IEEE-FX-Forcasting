## Leakage Assessment

### Strengths
- AdditiveAttention aggregator keeps temporal weighting explicit and auditable.
- Dependency bundle isolates version-specific hooks, reducing accidental cross-version reuse.

### Risks
- AdditiveAttention parameters not exposed in config, obstructing reproducibility if defaults change.
- Train/val split identical to v_03 retains narrow validation coverage.

### Recommended Mitigations
- Surface AdditiveAttention key dimensions in configuration and widen validation split during reruns.

## Validation Notes
- Confirm split ratios and block configurations via the companion inventory checklist before reruns.
