## Leakage Assessment

### Strengths
- Optional dense bridge before output encourages separation of sequence summarisation and regression head.
- Mix-of-Experts scaffolding present for experimentation but off by default, limiting surprise coupling.

### Risks
- MultiHeadAttention head after BiLSTM may attend across validation timesteps if stateful training is enabled (currently false but undocumented).
- Dropout remains disabled despite increased model capacity.

### Recommended Mitigations
- Explicitly document assumption about stateful=False training and evaluate dropout>0 runs.

## Validation Notes
- Confirm split ratios and block configurations via the companion inventory checklist before reruns.
