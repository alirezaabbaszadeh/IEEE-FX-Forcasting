## Leakage Assessment

### Strengths
- Maintains proven residual stack while preparing Mix-of-Experts interface without enabling it.
- Dependency bundle consistent with orchestrator expectations.

### Risks
- Unused Mix-of-Experts layer could diverge from production path if future hooks enable it without tests.
- Configuration still omits dropout/l2 for larger receptive fields.

### Recommended Mitigations
- Remove dead-code Mix-of-Experts or add smoke tests before activation.

## Validation Notes
- Confirm split ratios and block configurations via the companion inventory checklist before reruns.
